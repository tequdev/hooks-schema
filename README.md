# XRPL Hooks Schema

(WORK IN PROGRESS)

ABI standard for XRP Ledger Hooks.

Hook developers can publish definition information following this standard so that wallets and explorers can display various types of Hook information in a readable format.

Explorer and Wallet developers can create their own Schema Decoder to display HookState and Parameter in their own way
